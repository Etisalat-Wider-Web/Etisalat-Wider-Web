# Etisalat Wider Web
###### The first of its kind* autistic-friendly web extension

The web can easily become overwhelming to people with Autism. That’s why we created Etisalat Wider Web to simplify the way some experience the web. The web extension is the first of its kind and curates the user experience to people who are on the autistic spectrum.

Etisalat Wider Web adopts a wide range of technologies in order to streamline the experience of autistic people on the web:

Cleared up interface

Option to choose a sans serif font

Three color schemes: dark, medium and light grey

Advertising removal

Blocking of video’s auto play

Audio volume reduction

The extension is available on almost every website and in every language. It’s currently optimized for the most visited UAE websites.

Please note that the extension isn’t adaptable to some blacklisted websites. Please get in touch with these sites’ developers to ask for adaptability.

All feedback is welcome and encouraged through the report button on the extension interface.

We are also very proud to say that the extension, although developed by Etisalat, is an open source technology and we invite anyone to contribute to its constant improvement and wider adoption.

*According to autism experts in the UAE.
